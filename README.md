# Proximate-Analysis-of-Coal-Based-on-Spectral-Data-and-a-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Predicted moisture (%), ash (%), volatile matter (%), fixed carbon (%), and heating value (J/g) of Coal from their absorbance spectral data Implemeted the existing research paper with tensorflow-keras framework on collected absorbance spectral data. Extracted spectral features through a convolutional neural network of custom architecture. Applied extreme learning machine, Random Forest, ANN to construct the prediction and analysis model of the spectral feature data
